# ChatKit UI Skill

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for building and customizing embeddable chat experiences using OpenAI's ChatKit.

## Overview

ChatKit is the best way to build agentic chat experiences. Whether you're building an internal knowledge base assistant, HR onboarding helper, research companion, shopping or scheduling assistant, troubleshooting bot, financial planning advisor, or support agent, ChatKit provides a customizable chat embed to handle all user experience details.

## Two Integration Approaches

1. **Recommended integration**: Embed ChatKit in your frontend, customize its look and feel, let OpenAI host and scale the backend from Agent Builder. Requires a development server.
2. **Advanced integration**: Run ChatKit on your own infrastructure. Use the ChatKit Python SDK and connect to any agentic backend. Use widgets to build the frontend.

This skill covers both approaches to help you build agents without reinventing the chat UI.
