# Plan Quality Improver Skill

This skill improves plan documents based on analysis reports from the Plan Quality Analyzer Skill. It operates strictly within a Spec-Driven Development workflow and is responsible for IMPROVING a project plan document based on structured analysis results.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you have:
- An original plan document
- A Plan Quality Analysis Report generated by the plan-quality-analyzer skill (optional but recommended)
- Need to apply the identified improvements systematically

## Input Requirements

The skill receives:
1. A Plan document (Markdown)
2. (Optional) A Plan Quality Analysis Report generated by the Plan Quality Analyzer Skill
3. (Optional) constitution.md for validation of constraints

If an analysis report is provided, the improver MUST treat it as authoritative.
If not provided, the skill must conservatively infer improvements without speculation.

## Improvement Principles (Strict)

1. Do NOT add new phases, steps, or workflows not already implied
2. Do NOT convert plan steps into tasks
3. Do NOT include code-level details
4. Do NOT introduce new terminology unless clarification is necessary
5. Do NOT contradict the specification or constitution
6. Improve only what is unclear, incomplete, or risky
7. DO preserve original scope and intent
8. DO improve clarity, completeness, and executability

## Quality Dimensions to Improve

### A. Clarity Improvements
Enhance:
- Ambiguous plan steps
- Vague sequencing language
- Implicit assumptions
- Unclear responsibilities
- Missing entry or exit conditions

### B. Acceptance Criteria at Plan Level
Ensure that major plan milestones include:
- Completion conditions
- Success indicators
- Validation expectations
- Review or verification points

Acceptance criteria must remain HIGH-LEVEL and PROCESS-ORIENTED.

### C. Edge Case Coverage
Strengthen plan robustness by addressing:
- Plan failure scenarios
- Dependency failures
- Partial execution cases
- Rework or iteration paths
- Validation failures

### D. Consistency & Flow
Improve:
- Step ordering
- Logical transitions
- Terminology consistency
- Alignment with spec-driven workflow
- Explicit dependencies between steps

## Change Application Rules

When improving the plan:
- Preserve the original structure whenever possible
- Only modify sections that require improvement
- Add clarifying notes only when necessary
- Avoid redundancy
- Maintain professional, technical tone

Each modification must be defensible as a quality improvement.

## Output Contract

The skill must output a REVISED VERSION of the Plan document with improvements applied.

All changes must:
- Be minimal
- Be traceable
- Be justified
- Remain at the PLAN level
- Respect constitution constraints

The output must clearly distinguish:
- Original content
- Improved or clarified content

## Output Format (Mandatory)

The skill returns ONLY valid Markdown using the following structure exactly:

```markdown
# Improved Plan Document

## Change Summary
- High-level overview of what was improved
- Number of clarity improvements
- Number of acceptance criteria enhancements
- Number of edge case considerations added

## Revised Plan
(Provide the full revised plan with improvements applied)

## Improvement Rationale
- Bullet list explaining why each category of change was made
- Reference corresponding issues from the analysis report if provided
```

## Non-Goals (Absolutely Forbidden)

- No code generation
- No task breakdown
- No architecture redesign
- No feature suggestions
- No speculative enhancements
- No future phase assumptions
- No modification of specifications
- No invention of new features
- No change of scope

## Helper Tools

The skill includes:
- `scripts/improve_plan.sh` - Command-line helper for applying improvements
- `references/improvement-patterns.md` - Detailed patterns for applying changes
- `assets/improvement-template.md` - Template for output structure
