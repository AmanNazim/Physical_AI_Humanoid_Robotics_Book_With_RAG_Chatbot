# Spec Quality Improver Skill

This skill improves specification documents based on analysis reports from the Spec Quality Analyzer Skill. It operates STRICTLY on identified issues and recommendations while preserving original intent and scope.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you have:
- An original specification document
- A Spec Quality Analysis Report generated by the spec-quality-analyzer skill
- Need to apply the identified improvements systematically

## Input Requirements

The skill receives:
1. Original specification document (Markdown)
2. Spec Quality Analysis Report (Markdown) - generated by spec-quality-analyzer
3. Optional constitution.md for rule validation

The analysis report is the SINGLE SOURCE OF AUTHORITY for what may be changed or improved.

If an issue is NOT present in the analysis report, the skill MUST NOT modify that part of the spec.

## Absolute Improvement Rules

1. DO NOT invent new features
2. DO NOT expand scope
3. DO NOT add new requirements
4. DO NOT introduce implementation details
5. DO NOT assume user intent beyond the spec
6. DO NOT modify unrelated sections
7. DO NOT change terminology unless recommended
8. DO NOT violate constitution rules

All changes MUST be directly traceable to:
- A clarity issue
- A missing acceptance criterion
- A missing edge case
- An explicit improvement recommendation

## Improvement Strategy

Apply improvements in the following order:

### Step 1: Clarify Ambiguous Requirements
- Rewrite vague language using precise, testable wording
- Replace subjective terms with objective constraints
- Explicitly define undefined terms
- Separate mixed responsibilities into clear statements

### Step 2: Strengthen Acceptance Criteria
- Ensure every functional requirement has acceptance criteria
- Convert criteria into measurable, testable conditions
- Prefer Given / When / Then style where applicable
- Ensure acceptance criteria fully cover success and failure paths

### Step 3: Add Missing Edge Cases
- Add edge cases ONLY where flagged by the analysis report
- Clearly label edge cases
- Keep them concise and scenario-focused
- Do not introduce new behavior

### Step 4: Apply Structural Improvements
- Improve section ordering if recommended
- Normalize formatting
- Improve consistency and readability
- Preserve original section hierarchy unless improvement is justified

## Quality Safeguards

- Preserve original meaning at all times
- Prefer minimal, surgical changes
- Avoid over-verbosity
- Maintain professional, formal tone
- Ensure spec remains implementable and testable

## Output Format

The skill outputs TWO artifacts:

### 1. Improved Specification
- Full revised spec in Markdown
- Same filename as input spec (conceptually)
- All improvements integrated cleanly
- No annotations inside the spec text

### 2. Improvement Traceability Report
- Maps original issue ID → Applied improvement
- Shows section modified and type of improvement
- Ensures auditability and transparency

## Output Structure Template

The final output follows this exact structure:

```markdown
# Improved Specification
<full improved spec content here>

---

# Improvement Traceability Report

| Issue ID | Spec Section | Improvement Type | Summary |
|--------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| QI-01  | Requirements | Clarity           | Clarified vague wording |
| AC-02  | Feature X    | Acceptance        | Added measurable criteria |
| EC-01  | Feature Y    | Edge Case         | Added invalid input case |
```

## Non-Goals (Absolutely Forbidden)

- No code generation
- No planning or task breakdown
- No architectural redesign
- No future-phase assumptions
- No speculative enhancements
- No optimization suggestions beyond analysis report

## Quality Validation Process

Before completing the improvement:

1. Verify every change maps to an issue in the analysis report
2. Confirm original intent is preserved
3. Ensure scope has not expanded
4. Check that constitution rules are followed
5. Validate that traceability report is complete

## Helper Tools

The skill includes:
- `scripts/improve_spec.sh` - Command-line helper for applying improvements
- `references/improvement-patterns.md` - Detailed patterns for applying changes
- `assets/improvement-template.md` - Template for output structure
