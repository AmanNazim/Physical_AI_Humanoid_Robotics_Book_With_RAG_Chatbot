# Tasks Quality Improver Skill

This skill improves Tasks.md documents based on analysis reports from the Tasks Quality Analyzer Skill. It operates strictly within a Spec-Driven Development workflow and must be used ONLY AFTER a Tasks Quality Analyzer Skill has produced its analysis report.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you have:
- An original tasks.md file
- A Tasks Quality Analyzer Report generated by the tasks-quality-analyzer skill
- Optional spec.md and constitution.md for validation
- Need to apply the identified improvements systematically

## Input Requirements

The skill receives:
- tasks.md (original)
- Tasks Quality Analyzer Report
- Optional spec.md
- Optional constitution.md

If analyzer output is missing or incomplete, the skill must refuse to proceed and explain why.

## Strict Non-Hallucination Rules

1. Do NOT invent new features
2. Do NOT expand scope beyond the provided spec
3. Do NOT add tasks for phases not explicitly defined
4. Do NOT introduce technologies, tools, or architectures not mentioned
5. Every added or modified task MUST be traceable to:
   - the spec.md
   - the analyzer report
   - or an explicit gap in task coverage

If justification cannot be found, DO NOT add the task.

## Task Improvement Responsibilities

### A. Improve Unclear or Ambiguous Tasks
- Rewrite vague task descriptions into precise, objective statements
- Remove subjective language (e.g., "properly", "nicely", "handle well")
- Clarify inputs, outputs, and expected behavior
- Ensure each task has a single responsibility

### B. Add Missing Tasks
Add tasks ONLY when:
- Analyzer explicitly flagged missing coverage
- Spec logically requires preparatory or supporting tasks
- Edge-case handling is required but missing

Each added task MUST:
- Reference the originating requirement
- Be minimal and justified
- Fit naturally into the task sequence

### C. Improve Task Granularity
- Split oversized tasks into atomic units
- Ensure tasks are small enough to be implemented in a single Claude Code run
- Avoid multi-concern tasks
- Avoid implementation details beyond task scope

### D. Improve Edge Case Coverage
Add or refine tasks to handle:
- Invalid inputs
- Empty states
- Boundary conditions
- Duplicate operations
- Failure and recovery scenarios
- User cancellation or interruption

Edge-case tasks must be clearly labeled.

### E. Improve Recommendations Integration
- Convert analyzer recommendations into concrete task-level improvements
- Remove vague "recommendation-only" wording
- Ensure tasks remain actionable and spec-aligned

## Task Structure Requirements

Each task MUST include:

- Task ID (stable, unique)
- Clear title
- Description
- Related requirement or spec reference
- Acceptance criteria (brief, testable)
- Dependency (if any)

Example format:

- **Task ID:** T-001
- **Title:** Implement in-memory task repository
- **Description:** Create an in-memory repository that stores task entities and supports CRUD operations.
- **Spec Reference:** FR-1.2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Tasks can be added, retrieved, updated, and deleted
  - Data exists only for the runtime of the application
- **Dependencies:** None

## Quality Bar (Advanced Level)

The resulting tasks.md should:
- Be directly implementable via Claude Code
- Minimize iteration and rework
- Cover functional and edge-case behavior
- Reflect professional engineering standards
- Clearly demonstrate Spec-Driven Development maturity

## Output Contract

The skill MUST output:
- A fully rewritten and improved tasks.md
- Clearly structured
- Implementation-ready
- Atomic and testable tasks
- Proper ordering and dependencies

The output MUST be valid Markdown ONLY.

## Non-Goals (Absolutely Forbidden)

- No code generation
- No plan.md creation
- No spec rewriting
- No assumptions beyond inputs
- No architecture invention
- No modification of specifications
- No invention of new features
- No scope expansion

## Helper Tools

The skill includes:
- `scripts/improve_tasks.sh` - Command-line helper for applying improvements
- `references/improvement-patterns.md` - Detailed patterns for applying changes
- `assets/improvement-template.md` - Template for output structure
