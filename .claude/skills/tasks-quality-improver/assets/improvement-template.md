- **Description:** Detailed description of what to implement
- **Spec Reference:** Reference to original requirement
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Specific, testable conditions for success
- **Dependencies:** Other tasks this depends on

(List all tasks with proper structure)
```

## Improved Tasks Guidelines

- Preserve all original task functionality and requirements
- Only modify tasks that were flagged in the analysis report
- Apply changes systematically based on issue categories
- Maintain original task sequence unless dependency issues require changes
- Use consistent formatting and structure

## Task Quality Guidelines

- Each task should be implementable in a single iteration
- Tasks should have clear, testable acceptance criteria
- Dependencies between tasks should be explicit
- Task titles should be specific and actionable
- Descriptions should be detailed but not include implementation details
