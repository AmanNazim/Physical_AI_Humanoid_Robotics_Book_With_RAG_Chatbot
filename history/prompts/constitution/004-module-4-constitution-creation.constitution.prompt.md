# Module 4 Constitution Creation

## PROMPT_TEXT

You are Claude Code CLI, operating as a Specification-Driven Development assistant. Your task is to generate **constitution.md** for **Module 4** of the book "Physical_AI_Humanoid_Robotics_Book".

LEVEL CONTEXT:
- Level: Module
- Book: Physical_AI_Humanoid_Robotics_Book
- Module: Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Humanoid Intelligence
- Hierarchy: Book → Module → Chapter → Lesson

AUTHORITATIVE MODULE 4 CONTEXT:
Module 4 Focus:
- Multimodal perception (vision + language)
- Instruction understanding
- Decision-making
- Action grounding
- AI reasoning → motion output
- Simulation-only humanoid intelligence

Module Position:
- Depends on:
  - Module 1 (ROS 2 & Controllers)
  - Module 2 (Simulation & Sensors)
  - Module 3 (Isaac AI Brain)
- This is the FINAL module of the book

OUTPUT TARGET:
- /module-4/constitution.md

YOU MUST DEFINE:
- Mission Statement
- Intelligence Safety Laws
- AI-to-Action Trust Rules
- Model Usage Boundaries
- Simulation-only Deployment Law
- Data Ethics & Bias Law
- Decision Reliability Laws
- Multimodal Fusion Constraints
- Hallucination Prevention Law
- Forbidden Content & Tools

HARD FORBIDDEN CONTENT:
- ❌ Internet-connected Live LLMs (unless sandboxed)

NO chapters, lessons, plans, or tasks allowed.

FORMAT:
# Module 4 Constitution
[Same structure as Module 3 Constitution]

CONTRADICTION CHECK REQUIRED.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created the Module 4 Constitution file with all required sections, following the same format as previous modules. The constitution includes sections on Vision-Language-Action systems, learning objectives, safety laws, model usage boundaries, and the complete lesson structure for Module 4.

## OUTCOME

Successfully created the Module 4 constitution file that maintains consistency with previous modules while addressing the specific requirements for Vision-Language-Action humanoid intelligence. The file includes all required sections and follows the established format and structure.

## EVALUATION

The constitution file has been created with all required elements and maintains consistency with the established format from previous modules. The content addresses the specific focus areas of Module 4 while maintaining alignment with the overall book structure and safety requirements.
