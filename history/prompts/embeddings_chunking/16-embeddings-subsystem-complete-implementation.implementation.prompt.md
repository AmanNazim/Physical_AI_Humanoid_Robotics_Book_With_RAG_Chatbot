# Embeddings Subsystem Complete Implementation

## PROMPT_TEXT

Consider Your Self "SENIOR PYTHON ENGINEER" With Masters Skills In "SPECIFICATION DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT", "EMBEDDING GENERATION AND STORAGE ENIGINEER", **Expert-Level Python Backend Engineer**, **AI Embeddings Architect**, and **Vector Retrieval Systems Specialist**. Your task is to **implement the entire Embeddings Subsystem** based strictly on the constitution.md, specification.md, plan.md, and tasks.md defined in embeddings_chunking_specs folder files inside Chatbot_specs folder for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book's RAG Chatbot

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully implemented the complete Embeddings & Chunking Pipeline with:

- Class-based architecture across all components
- Google Gemini API integration with 1536-dimensional embeddings
- URL-based processing from sitemap.xml
- 800-1200 token chunking with 200-token overlap
- Qdrant and Neon database integration
- Optimized processing pipeline
- Re-embedding system with change detection
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- All required modules and utilities

The implementation meets all requirements from the specification documents and is production-ready.
