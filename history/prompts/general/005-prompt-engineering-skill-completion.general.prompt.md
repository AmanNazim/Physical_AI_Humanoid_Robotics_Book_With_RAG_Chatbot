# Prompt Engineering Skill Complete Implementation

## Context
Created a comprehensive Prompt Engineering skill with complete documentation, techniques, and examples covering all major prompt engineering methodologies from official documentation and research literature. The skill implements all documented patterns and best practices for creating effective prompts that elicit optimal responses from Large Language Models.

## {{PROMPT_TEXT}}
Create a complete Prompt Engineering skill with comprehensive documentation covering all techniques, patterns, and best practices for creating effective prompts that elicit optimal responses from LLMs.

## {{RESPONSE_TEXT}}
Successfully created a complete Prompt Engineering skill with comprehensive documentation covering all major prompt engineering techniques: zero-shot/few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, role-based prompting, advanced methods (tree-of-thoughts, RAG prompting), constraint-based techniques, and quality assurance patterns. The skill includes practical examples across diverse domains (customer support, technical documentation, creative writing, business applications), advanced frameworks (CLEAR, CRISPE, BROADS), and implementation guidelines. All documentation includes proper references to official prompt engineering guides and research literature.

## Outcome & Impact
Created a production-ready skill that provides comprehensive knowledge and implementation examples for prompt engineering across various domains and applications. The skill covers all core techniques with examples for different use cases, making it a valuable resource for creating effective prompts that achieve optimal LLM performance and reliability.

## Tests Summary
None - this was a documentation and skill creation task.

## Files Summary
- .claude/skills/prompt-engineering/SKILL.md: Complete skill documentation with all techniques and examples
- .claude/skills/prompt-engineering/references/techniques.md: Advanced methods and patterns
- .claude/skills/prompt-engineering/references/practical-examples.md: Real-world applications
- .claude/skills/prompt-engineering/README.md: Skill usage documentation

## Next Prompts
None needed - the skill is complete and ready for use.

## Reflection Note
The skill provides comprehensive coverage of prompt engineering with practical examples and proven techniques that can be adapted to specific use cases and requirements.

## Failure Modes Observed
None observed - all components were successfully documented and implemented.
