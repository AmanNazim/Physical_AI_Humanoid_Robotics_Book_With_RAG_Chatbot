  Successfully updated the remaining two assessment files (03-isaac-perception-pipeline.md and 04-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md) with structured prompts for documenting the learning journey. All four assessment files now include the same structured prompts with sections for:

  - Initial Understanding
  - Learning Process
  - Challenges Encountered
  - Solutions Applied
  - Understanding Evolution
  - Key Takeaways
  - Final Reflection

  The prompts in the capstone assessment (04-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md) were slightly customized to reflect the capstone nature of the project.

  All four assessment files now have consistent structured prompts for students to document their learning journey throughout the completion of each assessment.

evaluation: |
  The learning journey documentation sections are now standardized across all assessment files, providing students with clear guidance on how to document their experience, challenges, and growth throughout each assessment.
