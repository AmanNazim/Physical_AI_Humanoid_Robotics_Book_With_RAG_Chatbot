prompt_text: |
  clarify the assessments specification file, it has the summary section where student will document there, should there be just summary section where they read the summary of what they have learned and what they have made, the complete journey.

response_text: |
  Clarification made to the assessment specification file regarding the "Summary: What You Learned & Implemented (end-to-end journey)" section. The specification has been updated to clearly indicate that this section requires active documentation by students of their learning journey, challenges, and solutions, rather than just reading a pre-written summary.

  All four assessment sections have been updated with the clarification:
  1. Assessment 1 (ROS 2 Package Development Project)
  2. Assessment 2 (Gazebo Simulation Implementation)
  3. Assessment 3 (Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline)
  4. Assessment 4 (Capstone: Vision–Language–Action Autonomous Humanoid)

  Each summary section now explicitly states: "This section requires active documentation of your learning journey, challenges, and solutions."

outcome: |
  Successfully clarified the summary section in the assessment specification to indicate that students should actively document their learning journey rather than just read a summary.
evaluation: |
  The specification now clearly indicates that the summary section requires active documentation by students, aligning with pedagogical best practices for reflection and learning reinforcement.
