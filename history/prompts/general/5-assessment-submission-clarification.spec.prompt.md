prompt_text: |
  clarify the submission section of assessments specification file, as the student will not submit to, they will show to real world, and update how they will.

response_text: |
  Clarification made to the assessment specification file regarding the "Submission Guidelines" section. The specification has been updated to change "Submission Guidelines" to "Demonstration and Deployment Guidelines" to reflect that students will showcase their project-ready implementations through portfolio presentation and real-world deployment validation, rather than submitting to a specific entity.

  All four assessment sections have been updated with the clarification:
  1. Assessment 1 (ROS 2 Package Development Project)
  2. Assessment 2 (Gazebo Simulation Implementation)
  3. Assessment 3 (Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline)
  4. Assessment 4 (Capstone: Vision–Language–Action Autonomous Humanoid)

  Each section now reads: "Students will showcase their project-ready implementations through portfolio presentation and real-world deployment validation:"

outcome: |
  Successfully clarified the submission section in the assessment specification to indicate that students will demonstrate their work through portfolio presentation and real-world deployment validation.
evaluation: |
  The specification now clearly indicates that students will demonstrate their implementations rather than submit to a specific entity, aligning with real-world portfolio practices.
