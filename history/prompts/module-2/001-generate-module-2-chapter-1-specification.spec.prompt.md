# Prompt History Record: Generate Module 2 Chapter 1 Specification

## Context
This PHR documents the generation of the Module 2 Chapter 1 specification file for the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book project. Module 2 focuses on "The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)" and Chapter 1 specifically addresses "Gazebo Simulation".

## Original Prompt
Please create a Prompt History Record (PHR) to document the generation of the Module 2 Chapter 1 specification file. The PHR should be created in the appropriate location under history/prompts/ and should document:

1. The task: Generating specification.md for Chapter 1 of Module 2 (Gazebo Simulation)
2. The process: Using specs-generator agent with proper references to module-level files
3. The outcome: Successfully created specification with proper lessons breakdown
4. The location: physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/specs/module-2/chapter-1/specification.md

Follow the standard PHR format with proper YAML frontmatter and documentation.

## Response Summary
The Module 2 Chapter 1 specification file has been successfully created at `/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/specs/module-2/chapter-1/specification.md`. The specification includes:

- Chapter description focusing on establishing foundational Gazebo simulation environment for humanoid robotics
- Learning objectives covering Gazebo installation, environment creation, and robot integration
- Detailed lessons breakdown with:
  - Lesson 1.1: Introduction to Gazebo and Physics Simulation
  - Lesson 1.2: Environment Creation and World Building
  - Lesson 1.3: Robot Integration in Gazebo
- Dependencies on Module 1 Chapter 4 and preparation for Module 2 Chapter 2

## Technical Details
The specification aligns with the Module 2 constitution and overall specification, ensuring consistency across the module's learning objectives. The chapter emphasizes a physics-first approach before implementing AI systems, which is critical for safe robot development workflows.

## Outcome
Successfully documented the creation of the Module 2 Chapter 1 specification, establishing the foundational Gazebo simulation environment for the digital twin approach in humanoid robotics education.

## Validation
- Specification file exists at the expected location
- Content aligns with Module 2 constitution and overall goals
- Lessons breakdown matches the curriculum structure
- Dependencies properly documented
