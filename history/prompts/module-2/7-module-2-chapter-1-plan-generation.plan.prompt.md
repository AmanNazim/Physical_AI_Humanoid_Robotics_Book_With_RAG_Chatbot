## Prompt

Please create a Prompt History Record (PHR) to document the generation of the Module 2 Chapter 1 plan file. The PHR should be created in the appropriate location under history/prompts/ and should document:

1. The task: Generating plan.md for Chapter 1 of Module 2 (Gazebo Simulation)
2. The process: Using Plan agent with proper references to module and chapter specification files
3. The outcome: Successfully created plan with lesson roadmap, milestones, and dependencies
4. The location: physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/specs/module-2/chapter-1/plan.md

Follow the standard PHR format with proper YAML frontmatter and documentation.

## Response snapshot

Created a Prompt History Record (PHR) to document the generation of the Module 2 Chapter 1 plan file. The PHR was created at /mnt/e/q4-sat-6-to-9/claude-code-development/Humaniod-Robotics-Book-writing-Hackathon/history/prompts/module-2/7-module-2-chapter-1-plan-generation.plan.prompt.md with proper YAML frontmatter and documentation. The PHR documents the plan generation task, process, outcome, and references to related files including the specification and overall module plan.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully created PHR documenting Module 2 Chapter 1 plan file
- 🧪 Tests: PHR follows standard format with proper YAML frontmatter
- 📁 Files: PHR created at correct location with appropriate references
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with Module 2 Chapter 1 implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: PHR properly documents the plan generation process for traceability

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - Plan aligns with specification
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate tasks for Chapter 1 implementation
