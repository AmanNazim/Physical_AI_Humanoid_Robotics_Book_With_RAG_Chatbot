## Response snapshot

Successfully created ADR 002: Task Structure and Organization Approach for Module 2 Chapter 1. The ADR documents the decision to structure tasks in a sequential, lesson-based approach with validation steps for Module 2 Chapter 1 (Gazebo Simulation). This decision cluster includes:

1. Chapter Introduction Task (T001) for creating introductory content
2. Lesson-specific tasks (T002-T007) mapping to each lesson in sequence
3. Validation tasks (T008-T011) to ensure content quality and alignment

The ADR documents alternatives considered, positive and negative consequences, and how this approach supports the pedagogical sequence while ensuring comprehensive content coverage.
