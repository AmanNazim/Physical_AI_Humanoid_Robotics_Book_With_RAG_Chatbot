## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: create-phr.sh script not found in expected location, causing fallback to manual PHR creation
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Verify script location or implement alternative PHR creation mechanism
