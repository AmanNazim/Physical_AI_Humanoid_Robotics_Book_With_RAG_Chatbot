OUTPUT TARGET:
- `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module-3/03-Cognitive-Architectures/lesson-3.3-ai-decision-making-and-action-planning.md`

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Implement Lesson content with high quality, detailed explanations based on chapter-3/specification.md, plan.md and task.md.
2. Include comprehensive learning objectives specific to AI decision making and action planning
3. Provide concept overview and scope as defined in specification
4. Step-by-step, detailed, beginner-friendly explanations
5. Include tools: Isaac cognitive architecture tools, ROS2, NVIDIA GPU for AI processing (as specified in spec)
6. Detailed explanations of AI decision-making systems, action planning frameworks, and adaptive systems
7. Include practical examples and code snippets where appropriate
8. Summary of what students have learned
9. Follow educational format appropriate for Docusaurus
10. Validate content against chapter-3/spec & plan
11. No hallucinations, no cross-module content
12. High Level Markdown compatible for Docusaurus

The content should be detailed, educational, and comprehensive, explaining AI decision-making systems and action planning for humanoid robots with practical implementation steps.
