# Module 4 Plan Update

## PROMPT_TEXT

Update the plan.md file of module 4, if needed, but do not remove details, using this prompt: You are operating as a Specification-Driven Development assistant Generate **plan.md** for **Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Humanoid Intelligence** of the book "Physical_AI_Humanoid_Robotics_Book".

LEVEL CONTEXT:
- Level: Module
- Book: Physical_AI_Humanoid_Robotics_Book
- Module: Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Humanoid Intelligence
- Hierarchy: Book → Module → Chapter → Lesson

AUTHORITATIVE MODULE 4 CONTEXT:
Module 4 Focus:
- Multimodal perception (vision + language)
- Instruction understanding
- Decision-making
- Action grounding
- AI reasoning → motion output
- Simulation-only humanoid intelligence

Module Position:
- Depends on:
  - Module 1 (ROS 2 & Controllers)
  - Module 2 (Simulation & Sensors)
  - Module 3 (Isaac AI Brain)
- This is the FINAL module of the book

OUTPUT:
- physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/specs/module-4/plan.md

YOU MUST DEFINE:
- Module 4 Learning Execution Strategy
- Chapter-by-Chapter Cognitive Skill Escalation
- Vision → Language → Reasoning → Action Planning Flow
- Simulation-to-Action Safety Path
- Book Completion Readiness Logic

HARD PROHIBITIONS:
- ❌ No lesson content
- ❌ No tasks
- ❌ No hallucinated AI tools

FORMAT MUST MATCH MODULE 3 PLAN FORMAT.

CONTRADICTION CHECK REQUIRED.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Updated the Module 4 plan file to match the Module 3 format and include all required details. The plan now follows the same structure as Module 3 with sections for Summary, Technical Context, Constitution Check, Module Overview, Weekly Breakdown, Chapter and Lesson Steps, Milestones and Deliverables, and Validation and Cross-Check.

## OUTCOME

Successfully updated the Module 4 plan to follow the required format and include all necessary implementation details for Vision-Language-Action humanoid intelligence systems. The plan maintains consistency with the Module 3 format while addressing the specific requirements for multimodal AI systems.

## EVALUATION

The plan file has been updated with all required elements and maintains consistency with the established format from Module 3. The content addresses the specific focus areas of Module 4 while maintaining alignment with the overall book structure and technical requirements.
