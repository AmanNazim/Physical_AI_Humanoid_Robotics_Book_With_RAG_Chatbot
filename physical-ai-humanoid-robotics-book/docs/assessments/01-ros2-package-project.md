# Assessment 1: ROS 2 Package Development Project

## Assessment Overview

This assessment validates your foundational understanding of ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns by requiring you to develop a comprehensive ROS 2 package that follows best practices for node organization, message handling, launch files, and modular architecture. The project evaluates your understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals, inter-node communication, and maintainable robotics software design. This assessment serves as the foundation for all Physical AI systems, establishing the essential communication infrastructure that enables humanoid robots to coordinate their perception, cognition, and actuation systems.

## What You Have Learned

- Understanding of ROS 2 node architecture and communication patterns
- Implementation of publisher-subscriber communication systems
- Creation of custom message types and service definitions
- Configuration of launch files for different operational scenarios
- Application of parameter management for different robot configurations
- Documentation and testing of ROS 2 packages in simulation

## Objective

Create a structured ROS 2 package with nodes, topics, services, and parameters. Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns. Integrate custom message types and service definitions. Use launch files for package execution. Include parameter configuration for different robot types. Document the package with proper README and inline comments. Test the package in a simulated environment.

## Prerequisites
