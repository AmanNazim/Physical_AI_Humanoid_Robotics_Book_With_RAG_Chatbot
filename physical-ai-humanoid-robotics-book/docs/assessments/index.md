# Assessment Modules

This section contains comprehensive assessments designed to validate your understanding across all modules of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum:

## Assessment Overview

The assessments are structured to progressively validate your knowledge and skills across the four core modules:

- **[Assessment 1: ROS 2 Package Development Project](./01-ros2-package-project.md)** - Validates foundational understanding of ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns for Physical AI systems
- **[Assessment 2: Gazebo Simulation Implementation](./02-gazebo-simulation.md)** - Tests your ability to create and configure realistic robotic simulation environments using Physical AI simulation-first approaches
- **[Assessment 3: Isaac-Based Perception Pipeline](./03-isaac-perception-pipeline.md)** - Evaluates your ability to implement complete perception pipelines using AI technologies in Physical AI contexts
- **[Assessment 4: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid (Vision-Language-Action)](./04-capstone-autonomous-humanoid.md)** - Integrates all systems from previous modules into a comprehensive autonomous humanoid robot system within Physical AI constraints

Each assessment builds upon the previous ones, creating a cumulative learning experience that validates your ability to integrate concepts from all modules progressively within the Physical AI framework.
