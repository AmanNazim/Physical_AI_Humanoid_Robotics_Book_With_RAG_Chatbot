# Chapter 1: ROS 2 and the Physical AI Nervous System

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of ROS2 architecture and communication patterns for beginner to intermediate students. You'll learn how to set up your ROS2 environment, create your first ROS2 workspace, and implement basic publisher-subscriber communication patterns. This establishes the essential "nervous system" foundation for all future robotic communication.
