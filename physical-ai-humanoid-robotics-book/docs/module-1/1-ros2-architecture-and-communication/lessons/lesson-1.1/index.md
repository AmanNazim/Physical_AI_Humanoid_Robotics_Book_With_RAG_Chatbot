# Lesson 1.1 – Introduction to ROS2 Architecture

## Learning Objective
Understand what ROS2 is and its role as a communication middleware in robotic systems, compare ROS2 with ROS1 and understand the evolution, describe the DDS (Data Distribution Service) communication model

## Conceptual Scope
This lesson introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS2 architecture. ROS2 is not just a framework but a complete communication infrastructure that allows different parts of a robot to coordinate with each other. We'll use intuitive analogies like the human nervous system to explain how ROS2 enables distributed robotic systems. The lesson covers the evolution from ROS1 to ROS2, focusing on improvements in security, real-time performance, and multi-robot systems.

Key concepts include:
- Distributed communication patterns
- Node-based architecture
- The role of DDS in enabling reliable communication
- Why ROS2 is essential for Physical AI systems

## Expected Learning Outcome
By the end of this lesson, you will understand what ROS2 is and its role as a communication middleware in robotic systems, and you'll be able to compare ROS2 with ROS1 and understand the evolution.
