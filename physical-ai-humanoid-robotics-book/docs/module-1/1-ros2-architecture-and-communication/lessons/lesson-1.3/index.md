# Lesson 1.3 – Basic Publisher/Subscriber Implementation

## Learning Objective
Write and execute a basic publisher node in Python, write and execute a basic subscriber node in Python, launch and test a ROS2 communication graph, understand the message flow between publisher and subscriber nodes

## Conceptual Scope
This practical lesson teaches you to implement the most fundamental ROS2 communication pattern: publisher-subscriber. You'll write your first ROS2 nodes in Python, creating a publisher that sends messages and a subscriber that receives them. The lesson emphasizes understanding message flow and the asynchronous nature of topic-based communication.

Key activities include:
- Writing a "Hello World" publisher node
- Writing a "Hello World" subscriber node
- Launching the communication graph
- Testing communication between nodes
- Documenting the communication pattern

## Expected Learning Outcome
By the end of this lesson, you will have written and executed a basic publisher node in Python, written and executed a basic subscriber node in Python, launched and tested a ROS2 communication graph, and understood the message flow between publisher and subscriber nodes.
