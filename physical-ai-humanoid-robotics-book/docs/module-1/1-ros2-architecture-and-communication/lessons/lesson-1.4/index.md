# Lesson 1.4 – ROS2 Command Line Tools

## Learning Objective
Use ROS2 command-line tools to examine communication patterns, understand node status and communication topology, work with services and examine service communication, understand ROS_DOMAIN_ID and network isolation concepts

## Conceptual Scope
This lesson focuses on using ROS2's powerful command-line tools to examine and debug communication patterns. You'll learn to use `ros2 topic`, `ros2 node`, and `ros2 service` commands to inspect running systems. The lesson covers network isolation concepts and how ROS_DOMAIN_ID enables multiple ROS2 systems to operate on the same network without interference.

Key activities include:
- Using ros2 topic commands to examine communication
- Using ros2 node commands to examine node status
- Using ros2 service commands to examine services
- Understanding ROS_DOMAIN_ID and network isolation

## Expected Learning Outcome
By the end of this lesson, you will have used ROS2 command-line tools to examine communication patterns, understood node status and communication topology, worked with services and examined service communication, and understood ROS_DOMAIN_ID and network isolation concepts.
