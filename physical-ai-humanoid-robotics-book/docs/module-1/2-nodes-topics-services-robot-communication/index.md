# Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, Services, and Robot Communication

This chapter builds on the foundational concepts by covering node development, lifecycle management, and advanced communication patterns for beginner to intermediate students. You'll learn to create sensor and controller nodes, implement service-based communication, and manage parameter configuration systems. These concepts form the core communication infrastructure of robotic systems.
