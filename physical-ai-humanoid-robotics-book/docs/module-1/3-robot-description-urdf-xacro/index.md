# Chapter 3: Robot Description (URDF/Xacro) and Embodiment

This chapter introduces robot description using URDF and Xacro for beginner to intermediate students. You'll learn to create basic robot models, parameterize robot descriptions with Xacro, and validate kinematic properties. These skills enable you to define the physical structure and capabilities of robotic systems, which is essential for simulation and control.
