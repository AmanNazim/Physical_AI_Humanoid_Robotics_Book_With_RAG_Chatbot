# Chapter 4: Bridging Python-based Agents to ROS2 Controllers using rclpy and Simulation Readiness

This chapter focuses on Python integration with ROS2 using rclpy for beginner to intermediate students. You'll learn to create Python-based ROS2 nodes, interface with simulation environments, and build complete perception-to-action pipelines. This chapter ties together all concepts from previous chapters to create a fully integrated robotic system ready for simulation.
