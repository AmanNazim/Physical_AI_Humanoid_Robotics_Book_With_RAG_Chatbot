# Plan: Hardware Requirements for Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book

## Plan Purpose

This plan defines the structure and flow for the Hardware Requirements appendix of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book. The plan establishes the ordering of sections, the flow of information, and the logical progression across hardware tiers while ensuring compliance with constitutional requirements that maintain the non-normative status of the hardware section.

## Technical Context

- **Feature**: Hardware Requirements appendix
- **Target Audience**: Readers of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book
- **Domain**: Computational environment guidance for robotics education
- **Constraints**: Must maintain non-normative status; no hardware mandates
- **Dependencies**: Book curriculum modules, simulation environments
- **Integration Points**: Links to physics simulation, perception, and VLA systems

## Constitution Check

This plan complies with the Hardware Requirements constitution by ensuring:
- Non-normative status is maintained throughout
- No learner is required to own, purchase, or access any listed hardware
- No assessment, module, or capstone depends on physical hardware ownership
- All book content and assessments are completable via simulation and/or cloud-based environments
- Capability-based descriptions are used rather than purchasing instructions
- Cloud-based GPU environments are valid substitutes for local high-performance machines
- Physical AI is described only as optional, advanced, or for sim-to-real experimentation
- This appendix does not impose learning or grading constraints

- Tier 2 expands into simulation-heavy and perception workloads
- Tier 3 introduces edge devices and physical robots as optional extensions
- Each tier builds conceptually on the previous tier
- No tier redefines learning requirements

### Language and Scope Controls
- Use capability-based descriptions only
- Maintain non-prescriptive tone throughout
- Avoid pricing references in all sections
- Avoid purchasing or vendor comparison guidance
- Avoid operating system setup steps

### Cloud Integration Requirements
- Include cloud execution as a first-class alternative
- Frame cloud usage as equivalent, not secondary
- Acknowledge latency or performance considerations without blocking language
