# Tasks: Hardware Requirements for Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book

## Tasks Overview

This tasks file defines the concrete writing tasks required to implement the Hardware Requirements appendix of the Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book. The tasks are organized to produce descriptive documentation only, maintaining the non-normative status of the hardware section and ensuring alignment with constitutional requirements.

- [X] T015 Describe optional environments for sim-to-real workflows
- [X] T016 Describe optional environments for edge deployment
- [X] T017 Describe optional environments for physical robot integration
- [X] T018 Describe edge devices as illustrative examples only
- [X] T019 Describe sensors as illustrative examples only
- [X] T020 Describe robots as illustrative examples only
- [X] T021 Explicitly restate optional and advanced nature of this tier

## Task Group 5 — Cloud and Remote Execution

- [X] T022 Write a section describing cloud-based GPU environments as valid alternatives
- [X] T023 Explain equivalence to local setups at a conceptual level
- [X] T024 Acknowledge latency or performance considerations without blocking language
- [X] T025 Clarify that cloud execution provides equivalent functionality to local setups at a conceptual level

## Task Group 6 — Conceptual Architecture Overview

- [X] T026 Describe the role of simulation systems (high-performance workstations for Isaac Sim, Gazebo, and Unity)
- [X] T027 Describe the role of inference / AI execution (systems for VLA processing and perception pipelines)
- [X] T028 Describe the role of sensing (cameras, IMUs, and other perception hardware)
- [X] T029 Describe the role of actuation (robot platforms for physical interaction and control)
- [X] T030 Keep descriptions high-level and non-operational
- [X] T031 Avoid diagrams, commands, or deployment steps in architecture overview

## Task Group 7 — Limitations and Tradeoffs

- [X] T032 Describe tradeoffs between local and cloud setups
- [X] T033 Describe tradeoffs between local and physical setups
- [X] T034 Describe tradeoffs between cloud and physical setups
- [X] T035 Frame all tradeoffs as contextual considerations, not blockers
- [X] T036 Avoid cost-based framing of tradeoffs

## Task Group 8 — Summary and Reader Guidance

- [X] T037 Summarize hardware tiers and options (Tier 1: minimum, Tier 2: recommended, Tier 3: optional premium)
- [X] T038 Reiterate that hardware choice does not affect learning outcomes
- [X] T039 Encourage readers to choose environments based on access and goals
- [X] T040 Confirm that all core curriculum content remains accessible through simulation and cloud environments

## Global Task Compliance Check

- [X] T041 Verify all tasks are informational and non-normative
- [X] T042 Verify all tasks avoid prescriptive or imperative language
- [X] T043 Verify all tasks avoid setup, installation, or configuration instructions
- [X] T044 Verify all tasks avoid prices, costs, or purchasing advice
- [X] T045 Verify all tasks avoid references to assessments, grading, or learning prerequisites

## Implementation Sequence Validation

- [X] T046 Verify Task Group 1 (Appendix Framing) is completed first
- [X] T047 Verify Task Group 2 (Tier 1) follows Appendix Framing
- [X] T048 Verify Task Group 3 (Tier 2) follows Tier 1
- [X] T049 Verify Task Group 4 (Tier 3) follows Tier 2
- [X] T050 Verify Task Group 5 (Cloud) can be referenced throughout
- [X] T051 Verify Task Group 6 (Architecture) follows Tiers
- [X] T052 Verify Task Group 7 (Tradeoffs) follows other groups
- [X] T053 Verify Task Group 8 (Summary) follows all other groups
