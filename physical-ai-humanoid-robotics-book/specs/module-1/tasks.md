- Set up development environment with Python 3.8+ and necessary build tools
- Configure ROS 2 workspace structure following standard conventions
- Establish basic understanding of robotics communication patterns (nodes, topics, services)
- Complete pre-module assessment of foundational programming concepts in Python
- Verify compliance with global book constitution requirement for beginner-to-intermediate progression
- Ensure access to simulation environment (Gazebo) for practical exercises
