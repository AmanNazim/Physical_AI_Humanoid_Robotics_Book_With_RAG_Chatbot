# Chapter 1 – Isaac Sim & AI Integration

## Chapter Description

Chapter 1 introduces students to the NVIDIA Isaac Sim environment and its integration with AI systems for humanoid robotics. This chapter focuses on establishing the foundational NVIDIA Isaac environment and basic AI integration concepts that all subsequent chapters depend on. Students will learn to install and configure Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation, understand Isaac architecture and basic AI concepts with hardware acceleration benefits, and establish the Isaac-ROS communication patterns that connect AI reasoning capabilities with robotic platforms. This chapter builds upon the ROS 2 communication infrastructure from Module 1 and simulation concepts from Module 2 to create the essential foundation for AI-robot integration.

## Chapter Dependencies

This chapter depends on Module 1 (ROS 2 concepts) and Module 2 (simulation knowledge) to provide the foundational understanding needed for AI integration. Students should understand ROS 2 communication patterns, topics, services, and parameters from Module 1, as well as simulation concepts from Module 2.

This chapter prepares students for Module 3 Chapter 2 (Visual SLAM & Navigation) by establishing the Isaac Sim environment and Isaac ROS packages that will be used for implementing hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM and navigation systems. The GPU acceleration setup and Isaac-ROS communication patterns established in this chapter are prerequisites for the more advanced perception and navigation implementations in Chapter 2.
