# Chapter 2 – Visual SLAM & Navigation

## Chapter Description

Chapter 2 focuses on implementing hardware-accelerated perception systems and navigation capabilities for humanoid robots using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This chapter builds upon the Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS foundations established in Chapter 1 to implement Visual SLAM using Isaac ROS hardware acceleration and integrate Nav2 for path planning specifically adapted for humanoid robots. Students will learn to configure Nav2 path planning for humanoid robot requirements, implement Visual SLAM with Isaac ROS hardware acceleration, and combine AI reasoning with navigation for intelligent path planning and obstacle avoidance. This chapter prepares students for cognitive architecture implementation in Chapter 3 by establishing the perception and navigation systems that cognitive systems will utilize for decision-making.

## Learning Objectives

- Configure Nav2 path planning specifically adapted for humanoid robots

## Chapter Dependencies

This chapter depends on Chapter 1 of Module 3 (Isaac Sim & AI Integration) to provide the foundational Isaac Sim environment and Isaac ROS packages that will be used for implementing hardware-accelerated Visual SLAM and navigation systems. Students must have completed the Isaac installation, Isaac Sim configuration, and Isaac ROS package installation from Chapter 1.

This chapter prepares students for Module 3 Chapter 3 (Cognitive Architectures) by establishing the perception and navigation systems that cognitive architectures will use for decision-making and reasoning. The Nav2 configuration and Visual SLAM systems established in this chapter will be integrated with cognitive decision-making systems in Chapter 3.
