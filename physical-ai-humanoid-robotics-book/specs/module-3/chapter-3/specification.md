# Chapter 3 – Cognitive Architectures

## Chapter Description

Chapter 3 focuses on designing and implementing cognitive architectures for humanoid robot intelligence using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. This chapter builds upon the perception and navigation systems established in Chapter 2 to create intelligent decision-making frameworks that can process sensory information and generate appropriate behavioral responses. Students will learn to design cognitive architectures for humanoid robot decision-making, implement AI reasoning systems for autonomous behavior, and create perception-processing-action pipelines for intelligent robot behavior. This chapter prepares students for AI system integration in Chapter 4 by establishing the cognitive frameworks that will connect with broader AI systems for multimodal perception-action capabilities.

## Chapter Dependencies

This chapter depends on Chapter 2 of Module 3 (Visual SLAM & Navigation) to provide the foundational perception and navigation systems that cognitive architectures will use for decision-making and reasoning. Students must have completed the Nav2 configuration, Visual SLAM implementation, and AI-enhanced navigation systems from Chapter 2.

This chapter prepares students for Module 3 Chapter 4 (AI System Integration) by establishing the cognitive frameworks that will connect with broader AI systems for multimodal perception-action capabilities. The cognitive architectures, perception pipelines, and decision-making systems established in this chapter will be integrated with Isaac Sim and hardware acceleration optimization in Chapter 4.
