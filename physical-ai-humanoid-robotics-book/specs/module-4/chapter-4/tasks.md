## Phase 5: Validation and Alignment Checks

### T025 - Content Validation Tasks
- [ ] T025 Check that `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module-4/04-human-robot-interaction-and-validation/index.md` exists
- [ ] T026 Check that `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module-4/04-human-robot-interaction-and-validation/lesson-4.1-vla-integration-with-simulation-environments.md` exists
- [ ] T027 Check that `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module-4/04-human-robot-interaction-and-validation/lesson-4.2-uncertainty-quantification-and-confidence-management.md` exists
- [ ] T028 Check that `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics-book/docs/module-4/04-human-robot-interaction-and-validation/lesson-4.3-human-robot-interaction-and-natural-communication.md` exists
- [ ] T029 Verify all content aligns with chapter-4/specification.md and plan.md
- [ ] T030 Confirm no hallucinations or cross-module content outside Module 4 scope

## Dependencies

- Chapter 4 depends on foundational knowledge from Chapter 3 of Module 4 (advanced multimodal processing and fusion capabilities)
- Lesson 4.2 depends on Lesson 4.1 (VLA simulation integration)
- Lesson 4.3 depends on all previous lessons (comprehensive understanding of VLA systems)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- T007-T012 (Lesson 4.1 content) can be developed in parallel with T013-T018 (Lesson 4.2 content) if multiple developers are working
- T019-T024 (Lesson 4.3 content) can be developed after T007-T018 are completed

## Implementation Strategy

- Focus on MVP first: Complete the index.md introduction document with basic content
- Incrementally add detailed lesson content following the sequence in chapter-4/plan.md
- Ensure all content follows safety-first design principles and simulation-based validation as required by Module 4 constitution
